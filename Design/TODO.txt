x	Proper error reporting with line numbers
x	Numerical constants as arguments
x	Variables
x	Endianness?  I think I did some kind of backwards byte order by accident
x	Convert register mnemonic to a numerical address via the register module
x	Need a way to map multiple devices / memory chunks into asm address space
x	Write in size of exe in exe
x	Param to the compiler to determine size of data page (Pragma?)
	Validation of argument type per instruction?
x		Like how "number" isn't really valid for a mov destination etc
	Need a stack
	Call and Ret
	need more clarity in execution args
		address / value
	Functions (x64 calling convention?  reserved call registers?)
	Writable screen device memory
		maybe start with a stdin / stdout kind of thing
	Text editor?
	string type
	byte type
	OS routines
		Filesystem stuff
			List files in directory
			Change directory
			Make directory
			Make new file
			Open/close file
				open flags like create append etc, steal from C# system.io
		List available functions?
		List available devices
			Ram available
			number of screens and pointers to screen memory
			control devices such as movement on a drone or roll for a lathe
		Device connect / disconnect stuff
			Detect adding of new parts
			Might increase available mem or screens or new control stuff or sensors
		Alloc memory pages
